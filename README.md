### Building Test Drive Images for Cumulus AIR

#### Prerequisites

The following packages/applications need to be installed on the build host:

- ansible (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- cloud-localds (via `cloud-image-utils` https://manpages.debian.org/testing/cloud-image-utils/cloud-localds.1.en.html)
- packer (https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html)

#### Create SSH keys

```
cd packer
./keygen.sh
```

#### Create a cloud-init config image to seed the initial provisioning key for Ubuntu images

```
cloud-localds ./artifacts/seed.img ./artifacts/user-data
```

#### Build the base images

```
packer build -var 'ssh_password=<PASSWORD>' oob-mgmt-server.json
packer build -var 'ssh_password=<PASSWORD>' oob-mgmt-switch.json
packer build -var 'ssh_password=<PASSWORD>' switch.json
packer build server.json
```

The resulting images can now be uploaded into Cumulus AIR and built into a bootcamp topology. An example topology definition is provided in `testdrive_topology.json`.

Then, create air image instances and get UUID.
- oob-mgmt-server
- oob-mgmt-switch
- testdrive-switch
- testdrive-server

Then update the OS in the .json with the image

Then, create the topology in AIR using the .json

Then, create a simulation instance using the topology instance.

Then start the topology and test it, Then power it off to get snapshot.
